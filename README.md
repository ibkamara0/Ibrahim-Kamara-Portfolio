# [Healthcare-Facial-Recognition](https://github.com/ibkamara0/Healthcare-Facial-Recognition)

For this IT Capstone Project, there will be research pertaining to the ability to use facial recognition as a form of healthcare identification during the emergency department admission process. This could benefit healthcare facilities in a plethora of ways including, but not limited to, an efficient patient identification process that maintains a high standard of patient confidentiality.

## Overview
What the implementation of this technology would look like is a patient enters the emergency department and instead of being asked for their name, driver’s license, and medical card as a form of identification, their face is automatically recognized by the software, as they enter the facility providing easy look. For example, a patient calls their physician and their chief complaint is a fever, body ache, and fatigue. This information will be stored in the patient’s medical records on a database. Upon entrance of the facility the patient’s face is recognized and at the desk,  and by the click of a button it may say “Jacob Park, Possible flu” along with other information like medical record number or date of birth, making it easier to direct patients throughout the healthcare facility, essentially decreasing the emergency department wait and transferring times. This could also improve patient experience and decrease risk of identification fraud.

# [Bachelor's Degree in Your State](https://github.com/ibkamara0/bachelors-degree-in-your-state)
Now for a little background on this project. Being a recent graduate and wanted to show my passion and skills to employers, I got curious. I decided to apply some of my skills to a project that appealed to my peers and I. Given we all just got our bachelor's degrees and some of us our looking for employment. I wanted to know where our bachelor's degrees most affected income and unemployment rates. Below, I get to take you along the journey of how this question was answered. Enjoy.

## Overview
- In this project data will be collected from US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service on Unemployment, Median Household Income, and Education Attainment
- Raw data will be cleaned and manipulated for visualization and model development
- Lastly, models and visualizations will be translated and interpreted to give data meaning in context of our research question.

# [Reddit-and-DJIA-Prediction](https://github.com/ibkamara0/Reddit-and-DJIA-Prediction)
This project was done simply for fun to gain some additional experience in the world of machine learning and natural language processing. I used data from Kaggle on which involved the Dow Jones Industrial Averages with different news articles. The data provided displayed various headlines and labels, where "1" meant the average rose or remained the same, and "0" meant there was a decline in the average.
## Overview
I trained this data with different algorithms then created a GUI(Graphical User Interface) that allows you to insert a headline from Reddit World News and get a prediction of whether the Dow Jones Industrial Average will rise/remain or fall. I used to algorithms to create a voting system, the more models that would choose a certain classification ("1" or "0"), the higher the confidence of the prediction. The comments in both my jupyter notebook and code explain what each piece does. Feel free to take this and apply it to your own datasets and scenarios.

Below, there are is a demo and a link to the dataset. There is also a link to some YouTube videos that helped me with this project.

# [Covid19-vs-Mother-Nature](https://github.com/ibkamara0/Covid19-vs-Mother-Nature)
As crazy as it may sound, my passion for data science is what motivated me to want to complete this project. I began this project hoping to visualize some positive data, in the light of our current situation. Lastly, I used this as an opportunity to enhance my knowledge in data science and potentially get some professional feedback.
## Overview
- Web scraped, read, parsed and cleaned data for easier implementation into machine learning model
- Created a visual representation of the relationship between increase in weather temperature and change in Covid19 confirmed cases
- Used machine learning to generate a model that displays a linear correlation between the two variables
- Extracted meaningful information from large dataset
